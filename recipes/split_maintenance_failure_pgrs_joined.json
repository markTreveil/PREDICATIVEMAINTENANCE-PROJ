  "description": "These are the letters which Endymion wrote\nTo one he loved in secret, and apart.\nAnd now the brawlers of the auction mart\nBargain and bid for each poor blotted note,\nAy! for each separate pulse of passion quote\nThe merchant\u0027s price. I think they love not art\nWho break the crystal of a poet\u0027s heart\nThat small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat.\n\nIs it not said that many years ago,\nIn a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran\nWith torches through the midnight, and began\nTo wrangle for mean raiment, and to throw\nDice for the garments of a wretched man,\nNot knowing the God\u0027s wonder, or His woe?\n",
